### Features (TBD)


### Notes (todos etc.)
Dimension-independent code
Cuthill-McKee front-marching algorithm.
Generate grid, visualise it (remove color-coding using the classes in the GridOut namespace)
view sparsity pattern
print mesh with location and numbering of support points
point-value (or mean) convergence (informal observations)
Verification through method of manufactured solutions.
Adaptive mesh refinement (condense/distribute first). Then add_entries_local_to_global next
solver, preconditioner, timing and convergence diagram. Geometric, algebraic preconditioners later on
Creating good meshes (test on unstructured meshes)
namespace
ConvergenceTable (global refinement reduction rate)
